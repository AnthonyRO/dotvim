This is my Vim configuration

To install it execute the following commands

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/zyedidia/dotvim.git ~/.vim
echo "runtime vimrc" > .vimrc
cd ~/.vim
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

To get the color scheme working you may have to install the solarized colorscheme for your terminal: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
