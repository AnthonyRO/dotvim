This is my Vim configuration

Lately I've been using Neovim but it should work with vanilla Vim as well.

# Installation

To install it execute the following commands

```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir -p ~/.config
$ git clone https://github.com/zyedidia/dotvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Then run `:PlugInstall` from inside vim.

To get the color scheme working you may have to install the solarized colorscheme for your terminal: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
